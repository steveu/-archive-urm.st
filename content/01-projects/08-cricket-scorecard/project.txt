Intro:

Web application for cricket teams to submit scorecards to league administrators. My design &amp; build.

Text:

A cricket league association approached us to help speed up the process of submitting match scorecards for verification (done by both teams after a match) and to prevent missing data.

In consultation with stakeholders (particualrly on the peculiarities of cricket rules) I led the design of a web application. Using the structure of a wizard style form; a complicated scorecard is distilled into simple steps which can then be progressively validated against league requirements to ensure correct results.

I developed the app using a set of PHP form classes which I've built up over a number of years at Designition. This allowed for fine-tuned validation and user-friendly messaging using limited development, allowing time to be spent on custom features such as automatic score &amp; result calculations.

I was particularly happy with how the step controls turned out;

And the occasional emotive message about the final result.

Feedback from users and adminisrators has been very positive, and has provided opportunities for design tweaks and future development ideas.
