Intro:

Web application for cricket teams to submit scorecards to league administrators. My design &amp; build.

Text:

Together with stakeholders I led the design of a web application for cricket teams to easily submit their scorecards to the league association for verification. Using the structure of a wizard style form; a complicated scorecard is distilled into simple steps and progressively validated against league requirements to ensure correct results.

I developed the app using a set of PHP form classes which I've built up over a number of years at Designition. This allowed for fine tuned validation and user friendly messaging using limited development, allowing time to be spent on custom features such as automatic score &amp; result calculations.

I was particularly happy with the design of the step controls;

And the occasional emotive message about the final result. 

Feedback from users and adminisrators has been very positive, and has provided opportunities for design tweaks and future development ideas.
