Intro:

I designed and built this vet advice site. Includes finely tuning search, and admin baked directly into the front-end.

Text:

Having designed the previous iteration, I approached this redesign both with insight into what the site's inner workings, and with a certain amount of caution to avoid irritating or putting off existing users.

Dramatically increased the volume of posts, and encouraged micro payments and donations.
