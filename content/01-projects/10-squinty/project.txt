A recent [A List Apart article on Artistic Distance](http://www.alistapart.com/articles/artistic-distance/) got me a thinking; As much of my designing is done in the browser (for better or worse) I could use a tool that lets me quickly take a different look at the things I’m making.

I did a quick sketch on the iPad (at the time being infatuated with [Paper](http://www.fiftythree.com/paper)) and toyed with the name *Perspective*. Maybe the poncey name put me off as it was shoved on the backburner, whilst I dealt with self employment.

I had another bash refining the concept last week (*this is why I’m self employed*) also coming up with the name *Squinty*.

Better name in place; I’ve spent the last couple of days developing the concept and I'm happy to say I built a pretty decent [prototype Chrome extension](https://github.com/steveu/squinty). It’s currently only available on Github and isn't tested beyond the latest and greatest version.

I'm sure I’ll get around to submitting the Chrome store but in the meantime; hope somebody finds it useful. Any feedback much appreciated :)
