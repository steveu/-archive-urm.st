Intro:

Innovative (for it's time) JavaScript driven site for a homeless shelter in York. Design &amp; build by me.

Text:

One of the design requirements was that the website should reflect the innovative branding done for the newly created homeless shelter. Using the a giant version of the logo in the background and it's simple shapes and bold colours, I created an innovative layout that was easy and fun to use.

Technically this build was ahead of the curve, using JavaScript scrolling and history state-changes. Whilst much of this is commonplace today (it's in use here), I was and still am proud of the technical achievement.
