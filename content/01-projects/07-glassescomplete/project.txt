Intro:

I wireframed this complex E-commerce site and did the vast majority of frontend development.

A long term client at Designition; Glasses Complete sell prescription glasses online and approached us to transform their simple E-commerce site to an all-singing shopping experience which would hold up against the market leader; Glasses Direct.

I wireframed user-journeys though a series of complex interactions, and was able to refine these when building the final website though prototyping different implementations.

The core experience is faceted navigation for frames; enabling users to refine their selection as they browse, whilst keeping a pick up and play element.

I'm very proud of my work refining the customisation of frames process which is both powerful and smooth and almost completely error proof. In particular I was able to  work in an additional requirement for multiple colour tints on frames in a way that looks like it was always meant to be that way.

The building of this site required me to write complicated checkout and filtering systems in PHP and progressively layer JavaScript interactions layer on top. I believe it made me a better programmer.

The site was a commercial success and is maintains that performance several years later with minimal updates.
