I've worn many a hat in my nine years making websites for agencies and increasingly for myself, developing a broad range of skills in various design disciplines, user research and both front &amp; back-end code.

I'm available for contract and freelance work, integrated into your existing team, or driving projects from research through production-ready code. I work from home, and at various drop-in offices and coffeehouses in York and Leeds. I'm happy to work with you on site. Have car, will travel &hellip;within reason ;)

Think I'd be a good fit for your business? Please <a href="/contact">get in touch</a>, as I'd love to chat!
