I've worn many a hat in my nine years making websites for various agencies and increasingly for myself. Building up a broad range of skills in different design disciplines, with a particular focus on interaction design, developed during a recent <a ref="">Masters degree in <abbr title="Human Computer Interaction">HCI</abbr></a>.

Technically I have expert skills in HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and a deep understading of both desktop and mobile platforms. I'm highly experienced using PHP, with knowledge of many popular frameworks and CMS systems, but also comfortable developing OOP systems from scratch. I have experience using Ruby (Rails), some iOS development work in Objective C, and am increasingly infatuated with node.js.

I'm available for contract and freelance work, either remotely, or working with you on site. Have car will travel &hellip;within reason.

Think I'd be a good fit for your business? Please <a href="/contact">get in touch</a>, as I'd love to chat!
