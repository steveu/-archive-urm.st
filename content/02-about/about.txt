I've worn many hats in my 9 years making websites; for various agencies, clients and myself, and I've developed a well-rounded design skillset. Whilst I have a particular focus on interaction &amp; interface design, I'm an accomplished contributor to a team design-process from user research through to polished products. 

## Geek speak

I'm an expert in front-end web development for desktop &amp; mobile using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I keep myself bang up to date and have experience of responsive design, advanced HTML5 and CSS3, toolkits such as <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">SASS</a> and <a href="http://compass-style.org/">Compass</a>, and server side JavaScript using <a href="http://nodejs.org/">node.js</a>.

I'm highly experienced using PHP with knowledge of many popular frameworks and CMS systems, but also comfortable developing OOP systems myself. I have some experience using Ruby (Rails), good knowledge of Git, and can (just about) maintain Linux based servers.

## What's next?

I'm available for contract and freelance work, either remotely, or on site, so f you think I'd be a good fit for your business; please do <a href="/contact">get in touch</a>. I'd love to chat!
