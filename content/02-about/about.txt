I've worn many a hat in my nine years making websites for various agencies and increasingly for myself, developing a broad range of skills in different design disciplines, with a particular focus on interaction design. I've also picked up skills in user centred design with a Masters degree in HCI.

I have expert skills in HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and a deep understading of both desktop and mobile platforms. I'm highly experienced using PHP including knowledge of many popular frameworks and CMS systems. I also have some experience using Ruby and iOS development in Objective C.

I'm available for contract and freelance work, remotely or working with you on site. Have car, will travel &hellip;within reason ;)

Think I'd be a good fit for your business? Please <a href="/contact">get in touch</a>, as I'd love to chat!
