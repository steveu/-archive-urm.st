I stumbled into a bug in Chrome. Thing is, I say bug, but no longer think it so&hellip;more a philosophical quandry and a potential flashpoint in the battle for the Web.

*It's possible I've over stated this.*

So when fetching content via AJAX, rather than a standard page request (hello geeks), it is sensible to also update the URL, therby avoiding breaking the browser back and forward buttons.
